	     The ntasks section specifies the number of tasks (or MPI
	     processes) for each component of the model. In this case,
	     the only component is set to -1. The negative value means
	     that the number of tasks for each component will be equal
	     to the number of nodes available in the computing
	     environment. Example: if our component is invoked through
	     bsub asking for 4 nodes, having -1 in this setting, each
	     component (we have only one here) will use 4 tasks, one
	     per node.
